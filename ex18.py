#From now on, I should probably use extensive amounts of octothorpes to be sure I've copied the code from the book. This way I will be able to catch the gaslighting a bit more easily, which will probably serve to make my life and afterlife more difficult since catching those merry pranksters does nothing for me.

#I've had dreams of people altering code, of my friend Jake Barnes doing a demented dance as he messed with a computer. I don't know what lesson I'm supposed to be learning. Suicide is bad? Well, I LEARNED that lesson, right about when I survived the gangstalking attack on the train. But years and years of gaslighting and torture leave their mark. Also, I've been subconciously programmed to think life is either a dream or a video game so I don't take life seriously except when I do. All because of a bad 1984 paper.
