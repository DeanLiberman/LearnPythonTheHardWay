# I am going to try to create a python program without consulting the textbook or the other scripts. Let's see if I can do anything more fancy than a print line command.

user_name = "Dean"

fortuna = 4



print "Hello, my name is %s." % (user_name)

print "I like the number %d" % (fortuna)

print "Sometimes I am afraid that %s will fall against %d" % (user_name, fortuna) 

# No good. I thought I could at least define two variables and use the %d and %s thingies, but apparently I haven't studied and practiced enough. NB - the percentage symbol(which my brain keeps on reading as "hashtag" for some reason) has to be included in the print line and outside of the print line. 
# On my way back from turning on the lights, I jammed my pinky toe. Is this a sign that I made a pinky promise but forgot it? Or is this just an illusion of me making a pinky promise that never happened, much like the montage of Pixar's Film "Up" that convinced everyone they had a childhood friend of the opposite sex who died tragically?
