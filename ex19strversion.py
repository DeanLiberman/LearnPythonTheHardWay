# Up til now I have made a string based version of exercise 19. I wonder if I can combine string variables and math without changing the function's %s to %r. (I don't think I can)

# tortillas_and_avocado ( tortilla_dea + 100, avocado_modo + 69.)
#No good. As the error says, I can't concatenate string and int. I still only barely know what concatenate means - combining strings with strings and intergers with intergers? 

# Okie Dokie, so it would seem that I kinda understand how to use a print function. If the function itself prints, then there's no need to add a print line. So
